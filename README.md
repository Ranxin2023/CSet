This is a program I created for realizing a sorted array.
I use an array and sort after initializing. 
Here is the time test for each case:
time spent for normal_find with size 100000:24.184000
time spent for set_find with size 100000:0.004000

time spent for normal_find with size 100000:24.363000
time spent for set_find with size 100000:0.003000

time spent for normal_find with size 100000:24.267000
time spent for set_find with size 100000:0.018000

time spent for normal_find with size 100000:24.036000
time spent for set_find with size 100000:0.018000

time spent for normal_find with size 100000:23.849000
time spent for set_find with size 100000:0.018000
